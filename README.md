# Ahmed's "TinyApp" Project


## Background

TinyApp is a web application developed as part of the Week 2 requirements during my enrollment in the Web Development bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. The goal of this four-day assignment was to create a web app using Node.js, enabling users to shorten long URLs in a manner similar to popular services like TinyURL.com and bit.ly.



## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cookie-session


## Getting Started

To get started with TinyApp and explore its features, follow these steps:

- Install all project dependencies by running npm install.
- Launch the development web server with node express_server.js.
- Register as a new user and start creating your personal library of shortened URLs.
